Introducing: Minecraft Unabridged! A pack I've been working on and improving since modded minecraft was on 1.5.2.
======
In this pack you will find something for everyone. Mods for those who like technology, magic, adventure, building, exploring, and more!

Truly, one of the main goals of the pack is to make sure there is considerable diversity in the mods available, catering to many different styles of play.  There will be no forced progression through any mod. The choice is yours to make on how challenging or simple your adventure will be.

Another goal is ensuring everything is relatively balanced. No mod should have too many negative impacts on a feature in another mod. In addition, great care was taken into making sure nothing is excessively overpowered compared to similar features and items in other mods.

Features unique to this modpack:
======
* Many custom Minetweaker scripts that introduce extra compatibility, fixes, and enhancements.
* Thaumcraft aspects added to the entirety of Plant Mega Pack and Biomes O' Plenty, making mostly everything that generates in the world scannable.
* Custom mining progression that works with both Iguana Tweaks/TiC tools and vanilla-style tools.
* Custom resource crops added to Agricraft,  including ore and mob drops.
* Tweaks to Agricraft, making things more difficult, so that Forestry bees aren't rendered useless.
* "Arcade style" hunger system that feels similar to the health mechanics of Minecraft beta, with the addition of heart drops from mobs that will restore your health.
* Custom ores added to the moon and mars to entice even the most timid adventurers to fly to the stars.
* Ore dictionary tweaks to Aether II items and blocks, making progression in other mods possible there.
* Unity texture pack by CyanideX is enabled by default for a more Unified experience.
* Custom main menu!
* Much, much more!
