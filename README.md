Introducing: Minecraft Unabridged!
======
A pack I've been working on and improving since modded minecraft was on 1.5.2.

In this pack you will find something for everyone. Mods for those who like technology, magic, adventure, building, exploring, and more!

Truly, one of the main goals of the pack is to make sure there is considerable diversity in the mods available, catering to many different styles of play.  There will be no forced progression through any mod. The choice is yours to make on how challenging or simple your adventure will be.

Another goal is ensuring everything is relatively balanced. No mod should have too many negative impacts on a feature in another mod. In addition, great care was taken into making sure nothing is excessively overpowered compared to similar features and items in other mods.
